<Comments>D14.00: changed from Declarable Substance   (nickel metal) to Declarable Substance Group
D11.00: ReportingLevel added.
Updated typical EEE applications.
1) Nickel must be reported in certain regulated applications where it is likely to result in prolonged skin exposure (e.g., an outer enclosure for a portable electronic product designed to be carried). Use of nickel or nickel contained in components and parts designed to be located inside the outer enclosure of a product need not be reported.  
2)The regulatory limit for Nickel in applications of prolonged skin contact - 0.5 micrograms/sq cm/week per DIN EN 1811.
3) Because exposure levels cannot be derived from actual concentrations, a threshold level of &#34;intentionally added&#34; is indicated for reporting. Suppliers may choose to report a default concentration of 0.1% by weight in the product for these substances, in lieu of determining the exact concentrations in their products, to indicate that the substance is known to be present in their product, as the actual concentration in the product is not informative for regulatory compliance assessment.</Comments>

<Comments>D11.00: ReportingLevel added.
Updated description of basis.  Inserted following comment:
Regulatory thresholds for substances in these applications are based on exposure limits rather than on the concentration in the product. Examples of regulatory limits for radioactive substances -a dose rate exceeding 1 μSv h–1 at a distance of 0,1 m.
Because exposure levels cannot be derived from actual concentrations, a threshold level of &#34;intentionally added&#34; is indicated for reporting. Suppliers may choose to report a default concentration of 0.1% by weight in the product for these substances, in lieu of determining the exact concentrations in their products, to indicate that the substance is known to be present in their product, as the actual concentration in the product is not informative for regulatory compliance assessment.</Comments>

The reference substance list is not exhaustive; the regulation only applies to halogenated substances if they meet the definition of flame retardant
The European Commission is preparing an amendment to the regulation that will change the reporting threshold to 0.1 mass% of halogen content in homogeneous material. The IEC 62474 DSL will be updated once the regulatory amendment is published</Comments>
