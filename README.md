## IPC 1752 Appendices Repo

This is an example GitHub repo to demonstrate how this open source, free platform may be used to more effectively collaborate and manage IPC 1752 Appendices.

Some GitHub features which can help the A-team:

1. Public repository fully managed by A-team without IPC dependency to publish newly released Appendices (for the REACH CL update that happened in Jan 2025, there is still nothing published on IPC)
2. All changes are tracked via the git version control management system by default, no configuration required (check the [Commit History](https://github.com/thatdoorsajar/1752-appendices-example/commits) of this example repo!)
3. Change log can be published in the README.md (the file you are reading now)
4. Manage discrete version releases to the Appendices which are clearly tracked in the [All Releases](https://github.com/thatdoorsajar/1752-appendices-example/releases) and by default include zipped folders of all appendices!
5. Possibility of permalink from the IPC Materials Declaration homepage to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/thatdoorsajar/1752-appendices-example/releases/latest) of the Appendices


### Please Note

The included XML files here are a combination of the current 1752A and 1752B Appendices and Implementation lists. The included JSON files are a demo script conversion of the XML Appendices to JSON. The conversion script is not currently schema compliant but can be updated in the future.
